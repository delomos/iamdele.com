<blockquote>I spent all last night playing with your Tinymce plugin. What a joy! Boy, have I been doing things the hard way! I loved your tooltips for the different settings. Not only were they informative, but fun! You seemed like a real person; not a manual of difficult to understand techie language! Bravo for an awesome plugin! I will certainly share it with others! I only regret having worked so long without it!</blockquote>

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3.  You will need to manually activate your buttons the first time you install.  You can do this by going to the admin panel, settings page, Ultimate TinyMCE.  Here, you can set your preferences.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Support Forum =

Please use my support forum <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">HERE</a> for expedited help.

= The text doesn't wrap at the end of the window and keeps going, creating a slider across the bottom of the window. =
I have found this to be because the line of text being entered has no spacing.  A single line of text, without any spacing, will cause the editor window to "grow".  Insert a space somewhere and the line will break to a new line.  

= The color picker feature always shows hex code #000000 regardless of what color I click. =

This is a bug in the TinyMCE core software.  This bug, as far as I know, is only seen when using Mozilla Firefox version 7.  Until the good folks over at TinyMCE can provide an upgrade, the only solution right now is to use another browser if you want to use the colorpicker.

= How do I use the Anchors button =

<ol><li>Highlight the text, image, or other content where you would like to insert the anchor.</li><li>Click the anchor button and enter a unique name for the anchor.</li><li>Now, highlight the text where you want the user to click TO BE SENT to the anchor you created.</li><li>Click the Link button in the toolbar, and on the popup window click anchors and choose the name of your unique anchor you created.</li></ol>

= I still don't see my buttons after activating the plugin =

You may have to click the button titled "enable kitchen sink" from your top row.  This will expand the editor buttons.

<strong>Update:</strong>This version now includes an admin panel.  All buttons are set to false as default.  To activate buttons, go to Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE and tick the checkboxes for the buttons you would like to include in your editor.

== Screenshots ==

1. <strong>Shows all of the available buttons added to the visual editor.</strong>
2. <strong>Just a small sample of what can be done with this plugin.</strong>
3. <strong>The front end view of the last screenshot.</strong>
4. <strong>Easily insert YouTube videos with just the link url.</strong>
5. <strong>Image Mapping is a fun way to make images more interactive.</strong>
6. <strong>Over 50 different animated moods to add to your blog.</strong>
7. <strong>Another front-end example of the tables feature.</strong>
8. <strong>Have precision power with a visual GUI to style your elements.</strong>
9. <strong>Easily insert javascript popups on your page.</strong>
10. <strong>Syntax Highlighter will bring your code to life (supports PHP, JS, CSS, and others).  Also includes numbered lines.</strong>
11. <strong>Design a custom message box for your register/login page.  You can even include links, images, and videos.</strong>

= 1.8 =
* 04-15-12
* NOTICE: This plugin version (and beyond until otherwise noted) is now only compatible with Wordpress version 3.3.1 and above.
* Bugfix: Fixed admin message being shown to all users.  Now, only admin will see admin messages.
* Update: Re-implemented "Help" tab for admin ultimate tinymce settings page.
* Tweak: Added function which will display row 2 of the editor by default when opening any post/page.
* Tweak: Removed a few pieces from the admin tab section, relocated to the new "Help" tab in the upper-right corner.
* Tweak: Miscellaneous tweaks for Internet Explorer compatibility.  (Although I don't encourage IE... use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> instead!)

= 1.7.9 =
* 04-09-12
* Notice: This will be the last plugin version before REQUIRING Wordpress version 3.3.1 or higher.  My next plugin version will begin utilizing new API's only available in 3.3.1 and higher.
* Upgrade: I "reduced" the main.php file into several, more easily manageable, files.  This will help dramatically with loading times on the plugin settings page, and the content editor page.
* Tweak: Performed a major renovation on coding.  Separating the main file into several smaller files made it easier for me to work with the code.  It is now easy to read, highly notated, and more concise.

= 1.7.8 =
* 04-04-12
* I wanted to begin a new version sequence now that the plugin is reported as stable across various platforms.
* Most of the code has been re-arranged on the main.php file, trying to make it easier for editing.
* I intend to break the main.php file into multiple smaller segments, to make it more managable.  This will have no effect on any settings or usage of the plugin.

* Those who are heavy users of this plugin, and who have not upgraded the Wordpress core to at least version 3.3.1 will want to do so in the very near future.  I plan to implement a few new features which rely on code only available in 3.3.1 and later.  This is not a final warning, but just letting those know the moment is getting close.

* A special thanks to everyone who contributes to the development of this plugin with their time, constructive feedback, suggestions for improvement, and most importantly, financial donations.  Those who help financially, are the ones who keep this plugin alive and moving forward.  So, a very heartfelt thank you to everyone who has helped!!

= 1.7.7.4 =
* 04-02-12
* Update: Added tab for users to apply the developers suggested default settings for this plugin.  My recommended settings will be automatically loaded and saved.
* Udate: Added "Admin Options" new metabox on settings page.  
* Update: Added two new settings under "Admin Options".  One for controlling the dashboard widget.  The other for controlling the link in the admin menu bar.
* Tweak: Fixed link from admin bar to settings page when viewing from the front-end of the website.  Thanks Jessica!
* Tweak: Added rss feed to dashboard widget.  The rss feed is from my wordpress plugins development website.
* Tweak: Allowed users to specify the number of posts to display in dashboard widget.  (click "configure" on dashboard widget)
* Tweak: Slightly modified various parts of the main tab section.

= 1.7.7.3 =
* 04-01-12
* Bugfix: Fixed error message regarding "Call to undefined function is_plugin_active()".

= 1.7.7.2 =
* 04-01-12
* Bugfix: Spacing issue with "update options" button, and the box directly beneath.
* Tweak: Removed most inline css used to display the admin settings page.  Most all css (for the settings page) is now rendered from a separate css file.
* Tweak: Added an "Admin Tips" section in the main tab area; explaining different features of the admin settings page.
* Tweak: Localized all admin settings page translation strings.  Still have to do the help popup pages.
* Tweak: Added a link to the top admin bar for quick access back to the plugin settings page.
* Tweak: The admin bar menu will dynamically generate new links if a user installs any of the available addons; taking them directly to the relevant settings page.
* Tweak: Added a dashboard widget.  Currently, it is being used for links.  However, I will incorporate a dedicated news feed into this widget in a future update.

= 1.7.7.1 =
* 03-31-12
* Tweak: Added unique screen icon to admin settings page.
* Tweak: Extended width of first column settings.  Some were spilling one word to the second line.  It was driving me nuts!
* Update: Added more information to the "Tabbed" area.  Getting ready to eliminate some of the sidebar content areas.
* Update: Removed feature to enable the tinymce editor in the excerpt area.  This feature was buggy, and I want to focus on bigger challenges.
* Update: Removed the custom styles option.  My plugin addons can offer a better option, with extended features.
* Update: Consolidated the remaining three options from the "Advanced" metabox to the "Miscellaneous Features" betabox.  There are now only three main options boxes.  Basically, the bottom two options boxes have been merged.

= 1.7.7 =
* 03-30-12
* Update: Another re-design to the admin panel.  Trying to clean up the length of the settings page.
* Update: I'm thinking about making the entire admin panel jquery.  This would allow users to "tab" through each metabox area rather than having to scroll down the page.  Use my feedback form to let me know what you think.
* Update: Getting closer to a true drag-n-drop experience with the buttons.  Check out this link for a "sneak-peek": http://www.joshlobe.com/test
* <strong>Notice:</strong> I've changed the "requires" version to 3.3.1 on the plugin download page.  Currently, this plugin will still work on 2.8 and above.
* <strong>Notice:</strong> Watch the changelog to see when the plugin steps up to 3.3.1; I will make sure to announce it here.  Once it does, the plugin will no longer work on any Wordpress version below 3.3.1 (to my understanding).

= 1.7.6.1 =
* 03-27-12
* Bugfix: Installation Error "Class 'WP_Screen' not found..." Fixed.
* Update: This error of "Class WP_Screen not found" is due to wordpress installations using a version below 3.3.1.  I plan to implement this feaure in a future release, so users will need to upgrade to at least wordpress version 3.3.1 to continue enjoying the features of Ultimate Tinymce.  Please watch the changelog before downloading updates to check for compatibility with your wordpress version.

= 1.7.6 =
* 03-25-12
* Adding a new Help System.  This can be accessed by clicking "Help" in the top-right of the settings page.
* I didn't plan for this release this soon.  So, the new help system is incomplete.  I will be adding to this in future updates.
* Adjusted save buttons back to normal (Renamed them to "Update Options").  Now each button will save ALL options, regardless of which button is clicked.
= Bug Fixes: =
* Removed Google Maps (again).
* Issues saving posts/pages. (Google Maps Related)
* Issues when working with images. (Google Maps Related)
* Issues with copy/paste. (Google Maps Related)

= 1.7.5.1 =
* 03-23-12
* Bugfix with copy/paste buttons.

= 1.7.5 =
* 03-23-12
* Completely overhauled the admin panel settings page.  
* ---> Now you can drag/drop, open/close, and sort whichever metboxes you like.
* ---> Visit the "Screen Options" tab in the top right corner for even more customization.
* ---> Follow this <a href="http://youtu.be/-Y76wqkRMWk">SCREENCAST</a> to watch a short video explaining the new interface.
* Added functionality to select which row each button will appear in the editor.
* Added a check all/uncheck all option when choosing buttons.
* Added Google Maps back to the plugin.  I believe all bugs have been worked out.

= 1.7.4.1 =
* 03-12-12
* Removed jquery causing issues throughout admin panel.  I will write my own jquery for the toggles.

= 1.7.4 =
* 03-10-2012
* Beginning a dating sequence for plugin updates.
* Added Turkish translation.  Thanks Münip Öniz !!
* Added option to remove all database entries when deactivating the plugin.
* Added jquery to the main options panels.  This will allow you to expand/collapse the title bars.
* Removed a function I forgot to delete after testing purposes.

= 1.7.3.1 =
* I had to temporarily remove the Google Maps feature, as it was causing conflicts with other buttons (inserting and saving emoticons, some popups not opening, etc.).  I'll continue to work on this, and reimplement it in a future release.
* Fixed warning message about "Plugin generated xxx characters of unexpected output".  This was due to an improper usage of the `foreach` php code.  The code has been rewritten and is valid.

= 1.7.3 =
* Added Google Maps button and plugin; giving a graphical interface for inserting Google Maps.
* Added Shortcodes dropdown selector.  This new button will list all of your available shortcodes in your theme. It allows you to highlight selected text and wrap the shortcode around it with a click from the dropdown menu.
* Added option for disabling wpautop.  wpautop is responsible for inserting the <strong>p</strong> and <strong>br</strong> tags into your front end pages.  NOTE:  Please read the associated help file for more info before enabling this option.
* Added a very cool feature which allows you to select from many different styles to apply to the tinymce editor box.  You can see the "Rainbow" effect on the description tab of this plugin.  Currently, there are six options; Pink, Green, Dark Pink, Dark Green, Rainbow, and Steel.
* Fixed bug with alert boxes image tiling unexpectedly.
* Updated a few of the help files.
* Added two additional optional addon plugins in the list on the admin page.  These will be paid plugins.  
* One is a Google Fonts manager, which provides an easy admin panel (and step-by-step instructions) on how to choose any combination of Google webfonts, and incorporate them into your site.
* The second is going to be a Custom Styles dropdown box customizer.  It will allow you to add your own custom styles to the dropdown box and have them applied to your website.  This will be ideal for giving clients the ability to select custom defined styles they can easily apply to their content.  This plugin will be available soon.

= 1.7.2 =
* Fixed bug with column shortcodes. (Seriously, this time ;)
* Added a few translation strings from the admin panel, which were not previously available for translation.
* Corrected David's website; in appreciation for Italian translation.
* Fixed example with column shortcodes.  I accidentally used a hypen in the example rather than an underscore.  So, when using any column shortcode, you should ALWAYS use underscores.  For example,<strong>[one_half]</strong>Example Content<strong>[/one_half]</strong>

= 1.7.1 =
* Fixed bug with the "Advanced Insert/Edit Link" button where NextGen Gallery button (and others) were not being displayed properly.
* Fixed bug with the column shortcode usage.  (Was generating a warning, rendering certain code inoperable).
* Fixed bug where the moods addon plugin was not showing as installed.  (Was always showing Inactive)
* Added a couple of additional options with inserting YouTube videos.
* Moved the animated moods button (when installed and activated) to row 2 of the editor.
* Added Italian translation files.  Thanks <a href="http://www.davidpesarin.wordpress.com">David</a>.


= 1.7.0 =
* I decided to remove the animated mood smilies from the plugin.  The plugin now weighs a lean 2.78 megabytes.
* The animated moods is now available as an addon plugin, and can be downloaded here:<br />http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/moods-addon-for-ultimate-tinymce/
* If you have inserted any moods into your content, please check to ensure they still display properly.  Since the images will have been moved to another folder, it's possible they won't be displayed.  You may need to go back and re-insert them again with the new addon.  I apologize for any inconvenience.
* Added a new box in the admin settings page for showing available addon plugins, and whether or not they are installed and activated.
* I figure this sort of option may be useful in the future when developing additional addons.
* Added a shortcode useage for line breaks in the editor.  By simply typing the shortcode <strong>[break]</strong>, you can insert line breaks in your post/page content that are safe while switching views and saving.  See the associated help file for more information on usage.
* Added column support.  Now you can split your post/page content into multiple columns.<br /><br />Example usage:  [two_third]This content would be in a  column two-thirds of the page width.[/two_third][one_third_last]This is the last one-third of the width.[/one_third_last]<br /><br />See the associated help file for more information.

= 1.6.9 =
* Added a separate button for the "Advanced Insert/Edit Link" feature.  Now, you have a new button next to the wordpress buttons for linking and unlinking.  No more having to go back and forth to the plugin settings page.  Check the help file in the plugin settings page for more info.
* Updated my documentation to help with the link features.  Please let me know if you spot any inconsistencies.
* Added a button for turning on/off Visual Characters.
* Added a button which allows you to print your post from the editor.
* Added a button for automatically inserting the date or the time.  Let me know if this feature is useful, and if so, I can add some custom options allowing you to set how you want your date or time to be displayed.
* I am seriously considering removing the "Animated Moods" feature.  This would free up about 5 megabytes of space to allow for newer features.  I'm already nearing 10 megabytes on the plugin now.  So, if this is of dire need to you, please use my forum or my contact form to voice your opinion.

= 1.6.8 =
* Removed the old tables option and replaced it with a new drop-down box table button.  This consolidated all the table buttons into a nicely organized drop-down list.  You still have the exact same options.
* Added a "Next Page" feature.  This will allow you to use the wordpress page break to "break" your post into multiple pages.  Click the help icon in the admin settings page for more information and examples.
* Added additional font sizes.  The drop-down list will look a little "funny", but if you hover over the font, it will tell you the size.
* Removed the custom register/login box option.  I have created a different plugin with this feature.  If you liked it, please download the plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-welcome-messages/">HERE</a>.
* Moved the 'styles' button to the first position in row 4 of the editor.  This helped with spacing issues.
* Made a few width and height adjustments in the 'emotions' and 'youtube' popup windows.
* Updated Bloggers section.
* Slightly modified the feedback form.
* Added a "Plugin Poll" to find out the demand for newer features.
* Added a Mozilla Firefox box and link to admin settings page.  In my opinion, Firefox is the best browser to use with the visual tinymce editor.
* Removed some miscellaneous junk files and code.

= 1.6.7 =
* Added more to the contextual help sections.
* Removed the toggle switch, as it was not compatible across browsers.  I will tweak some more and add again in a future update.
* Tweaked the editor button popup windows with some custom css.  Trying to make them a little more "pleasing" on the eyes.
* Insert and Cancel buttons in the popups are now colorized.
* Working on implementing yet another settings section, which will allow fine-tuning over the tinymce initialization process.  I have most of the code in place, but still working out the last few bugs.  This should be fully operational in my next update.


= 1.6.6 =
* Implemented a new dropdown table buttons feature.  Instead of having 11 buttons side by side, taking up valuable real estate, this new option will add a dropdown list for the different buttons.  A HUGE space saver!
* Implemented a new HTML viewer button.  This one is Awesome!!  Complete with syntax highlighter, line numbers, auto-complete, and undo,redo history.
* Added a YouTube button.  This will allow you to simply enter the video ID and the plugin does the rest, embedding the video directly into your post/page.
* Added a cool feature using Image Maps.  You can create basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and polygons; and insert them over an image, and they will each link to a separate place or content.
* Designed a toggle switch that will "hide" and "show" all the rows of the editor.
* I moved a lot of the CSS files around and made them easier for me to navigate while continuing plugin development.  If some of your CSS doesn't load properly, make sure to empty any cache you are using on your website; clear your browsers cache; and reload the page.


= 1.6.5 =
* Updated most of the contextual help sections.
* Tables will have to wait until the next update (I want to be specific with this one).
* Removed the Microsoft Word Help Document.  I will make this available as a download on my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">Support Forum</a> for anyone interested.
* Fixed missing reference to stylesheet "pop-upstyle.css".

= 1.6.4 =
* Added support for shortcode usage in widget areas.  You can now use any shortcode available in your theme (or other plugins) in your widget areas.
* I'm In process of performing a HUGE contextual help system.  Each option now has a little "Help" icon, which when clicked will open a new window with help information specific to that option.
* This will be a "work-in-progress" over the next few updates.
* Switched my Feedback Form to another provider.  It should remain in working order from here on out.

= 1.6.3 =
* Added a custom message box which will display on your register/login page. This is available from within the admin panel settings page. Simply "check" the box, enter your message, and it will magically be displayed on your register/login form just above the login box. This can, of course, be styled however you like.
* Added an option to enable the tinymce editor within the post/page excerpt box. Now, you can create your custom excerpts using the power of Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added an option to show the post/page ID in the admin menu for posts and pages. This is extremely helpful if you are using plugins which require you to enter the post or page ID. A HUGE timesaver.
* Added a few more "Save your Selection" buttons, so it's not just one button at the bottom of the page.  It doesn't matter which button your use, they all function the same.  It's more for convenience.
* Be sure to visit my support forum to see usage examples of Ultimate TinyMCE.  It's the best way to follow along with updates, video and image turorials, and knowledgeable community members. http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1
* The direct URL for the new features included in this update is here:  http://www.forum.joshlobe.com/showthread.php?tid=19
* As always, please go back and click "Works" again to help spread this plugin.

= 1.6.2 =
* Added support for div, iframe, object, param, embed, and pre tags.  You can now safely use these tags (and any attributes) while switching between Visual and HTML mode.  Also, they will not be stripped away when you publish a page.
* Incorporated some of the functionality from "TinyMCE Clear".  This allows you to use "clear div" tags and elements.  This option will have to be selected in the admin panel "Ultimate TinyMCE" settings page.  It will also add three new buttons to row 1 of the editor in Visual mode.
* You can now retain P and BR tags, if you use a style.  Please see my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">SUPPORT FORUM</a> for more information about how to use this feature.
* Be sure to check the <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">FORUM</a> anyway.  I have also added some news about newfound Keyboard Shortcuts.
* If you're happy and you know it... please go back and click "works" again for the new version.


= 1.6.1 =
* Added a new options box on the settings page for enabling/disabling two of the advanced features; Advanced Link and Custom Styles.
* These two features will be disabled by default when activating the upgrade.  If you use these features, you must "check" them in the admin panel settings page.
* Leaving these boxes "unchecked" will restore the default WordPress functionality of the insert/edit link button and the styles dropdown list respectively.
* My form only allows 100 submissions per month (free service).  So, if my feedback form doesn't show, you know why.
* Additional testing for compatibility with WordPress 3.3.  No known issues at this time.

= 1.6.0 =
* Added a community support forum for more concentrated and expedited help.  The links can be found in the Ultimate TiynMCE settings panel, or on the active plugins page under Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added a section in the settings page for bloggers.  Read the info, and follow along if you like this plugin.
* Added code templates for my next few planned upgrades.

= 1.5.9 =
* Fixed bug where tinymce was adding crazy white space.  I thought my last release had fixed this issue, but apparently it's not ready.
* I could use some extra testers for new versions.  If interested, please contact me using one of the methods on the plugin main download page.  Thanks.

= 1.5.8 =
* Working on ways to make formatting to not get stripped by tinymce.  Added default ability of transforming use of the enter key into "&nbsp" characters.  This should help with line spacing when switching between Visual and HTML modes.
* Adjusted various default behaviors of the tinymce initialization process.
* Added Dutch and Finnish Translations.

<strong>New Features:</strong>

* Added ability to use PHP code inside text widgets.
* Added a signoff shortcode feature.  If you always "sign" your posts the same way, this option will allow you to insert it into your editor via a simple shortcode.
* Both of these can be enabled/disabled in the settings menu.

= 1.5.7 =
* Received a few messages regarding the buttons disappearing when activating the plugin.  This was caused by the __construct() function conflicting with other plugins using the same function.  I rewrote the code so the construct function is no longer needed.  This has helped speed up tinymce loading time significantly.
* Added Japanese to the language translations.

= 1.5.6 =

* Changed all text strings to support language localization.  Please contact me if you would like to help with a translation.
* Fixed image paths to support wordpress installations in subdirectories.  Thanks to Redcocker - http://www.near-mint.com/blog/

= 1.5.5 =

* Added functionality to create shortcodes for use within the editor. (Please see the Microsoft Word documentation on the plugin settings page in the admin panel for complete usage instructions).
* Updated the Microsoft Word documentation to include support for iframe's.

= 1.5.4 =

* Added a couple of screencasts and a word document to help with how to use the TinyMCE.  These can be found in the admin panel settings page, under "Additional Resources".
* Added a few advanced featuers to the HR button.  This button will again be un-selected by default.  You will need to re-enable the button in the admin panel.
* Cleaned up some code, and reduced some of the functions into arrays.  This will have a pretty unnoticeable, yet still effective, decrease in tinymce loading time.

= 1.5.3 =

* Added a button for working with embedding audio, video, and flash files.
* Added a custom styles drop-down list... with plans on adding more.  Please let me know what you would like included here.
* Added a form to the admin settings page; please use this form to pass along your ideas to me.

= 1.5.2 =

* I've been working on this one for a while... You're going to love it!!  ULTIMATE MOODS.
* Ultimate Moods will add a new button in your visual editor window.  You will have over fifty, nifty, thrifty little animated smilies to choose from and insert them directly into your posts/pages.
* This little upgrade is sure to bring a new "look and feel" to your blogpages.  It's both FUN and FRESH!!
* Remember you will need to enable the button in the admin panel settings page.
* I'm thinking about working on a paid version which will include hundreds of new animated moods.  Please give me some feedback and let me know what you think.
* Don't forget to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9E5VNRBMVBCS">donate</a> if you can spare a dollar or two ;)  This upgrade took some time, and I'm sure many of you will enjoy.
* Fixed bug where having to save each row individually.  Now, you can make your changes to both rows, and save once.


= 1.5.1 =

* Made some minor adjustments to code.  Renamed my functions to be more unique.
* Noted the "save" buttons to make aware you must click the save button for each row accordingly.
* Added "settings" link to the plugin page where plugins are listed.
* Included a new set of BIG smilies.  These will surely draw some attention on your pages.
* Added link to please vote for this plugin.

= 1.5 =

* Fixed bug where Row 3 buttons were not saving.

= 1.4 =

* Beautified the admin panel for button selection.
* Renamed my functions so they will be unique.
* Added resources tab in admin panel linking to help sections.

= 1.3 =

* Replaced "Example Text" with small icons of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 1.2 =

* Added an admin control where you can choose which buttons you would like to display in the editor.
* Adds an option menu in the admin panel under Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Simply select which buttons you would like to add to your editor.
* Note: All buttons are NOT selected by default on first install.

= 1.1 =

* This plugin is exactly like my Ultimate Visual Editor Upgrade plugin; except this plugin does NOT include the 291 Google Webfonts.  I realized the increased load the fonts puts on the server because each font calls a separate HTML request.  So, I created this plugin to use in the mean time until I can figure out a better solution.
* Plugin was created.
